**No more hand-coding ESPHome display lambdas! 🎉**

Building a custom smart display for Home Assistant? Frustrated with manually writing YAML and guessing coordinates?

**Meet your new HMI Designer.**

This is a **visual, drag-and-drop interface designer** that lives right inside Home Assistant. It enables you to build premium, touch-interactive dashboards for various ESP32-based devices (like the Seeed reTerminal, TRMNL, standard touch screens, and more) without writing a single line of display code.


## What Does It Do?

- **Visual drag-and-drop editor** - Design layouts in your browser, see your actual HA entities update live on the canvas
- **Multiple pages** - Navigate with hardware buttons, set different refresh rates per page
- **Auto-generates ESPHome config** - Clean, readable YAML that you can paste into your existing ESPHome setup
- **Round-trip editing** - Import existing ESPHome configs back into the editor
- **Full device integration** - Exposes buttons, buzzer, temperature, humidity sensors back to HA for automations
- **Smart power management** - Battery monitoring, configurable refresh intervals, deep sleep support

**Use case:** Display a weather page when you wake up, switch to a sensor dashboard during the day, show a specific alert page when the doorbell rings - all automated through Home Assistant.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install via HACS (Recommended)

1. Add `https://github.com/koosoli/ESPHomeDesigner` to HACS as a custom repository
2. Search for "ESPHome Designer" and install
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Add Integration** → Search for "ESPHome Designer"

### 2. Manual Installation

1. Download the `custom_components/reterminal_dashboard` folder from this repo
2. Copy it to your Home Assistant `config/custom_components/` directory
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Add the integration via **Settings** → **Devices & Services**

### 3. Prepare Your ESPHome Device

**Important:** Copy the Material Design Icons font file first!

From this repo: `font_ttf/font_ttf/materialdesignicons-webfont.ttf`  
To your ESPHome: `/config/esphome/fonts/materialdesignicons-webfont.ttf`

(Create the `fonts` folder if it doesn't exist)

Then create a new ESPHome device:

1. Create a new device in ESPHome Dashboard
2. Let ESPHome generate the base config (WiFi, API, OTA, etc.)
3. Configure the correct ESP platform for your device (instructions included in the generated YAML comments)

### 4. Design Your Dashboard

1. Open the integration at `/reterminal-dashboard` in Home Assistant
2. Select your device type (E1001, E1002, TRMNL,...)
3. Drag widgets onto the canvas
4. Add your sensors, weather entities, icons, shapes
5. Create multiple pages with different refresh rates
6. Click **"Generate Snippet"**

### 5. Flash It

1. Copy the generated YAML snippet
2. Paste it below ESPHome's auto-generated sections in your device config
3. Compile and flash via ESPHome

Done! Your custom dashboard is now running on your device.

### 6. Connect & Automate

Once flashed, your device will come online.

1. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** in Home Assistant.
2. Your device should be discovered (or you can add it via the ESPHome integration).
3. **Configure it** to ensure Home Assistant connects to its API.

### Philosophy: Design here, Automate there.

Think of this tool as the **Frontend Designer** for your physical display.

- **Use this tool** to make it look beautiful (pixel-perfect placement, fonts, icons).
- **Use Home Assistant** for the logic.

We expose everything (buttons, sensors, battery) back to Home Assistant. Does a button press toggle a light? Play a sound? Trigger a scene? **Do that in Home Assistant Automations**, where HA shines best.

## Technical Details

The generator produces **complete, standalone YAML** - no templates needed!

**What it generates (everything you need):**
- Hardware configuration: `esphome:`, `esp32:`, `psram:`, `i2c:`, `spi:`
- Display driver and settings
- `globals:` - Display page tracking, refresh intervals
- `font:` - Dynamic font generation based on your widget sizes + Material Design Icons
- `image:` - Image definitions for photo/image widgets
- `online_image:` - Definitions for online image widgets
- `text_sensor:` - Home Assistant entities used in your widgets
- `graph:` - Graph widget configurations
- `button:` - Page navigation and refresh controls (exposed to HA)
- `script:` - Smart refresh logic with per-page interval support
- `deep_sleep:` - Power saving logic (if enabled)
- `display:` - Lambda code that renders your layout

**What ESPHome provides** (auto-generated when you create a device):
- `wifi:`, `api:`, `ota:`, `logger:`

The workflow is safe and deterministic - same layout always produces the same YAML.


## Hardware Support

## Repository Structure

- `custom_components/reterminal_dashboard/` - Home Assistant integration
  - `yaml_generator.py` - Generates ESPHome snippets from layouts
  - `yaml_parser.py` - Imports ESPHome code back into editor
  - `frontend/editor.html` - Visual drag-and-drop editor UI
- `esphome/reterminal_e1001_lambda.yaml` - Hardware template with step-by-step instructions
- `font_ttf/font_ttf/materialdesignicons-webfont.ttf` - Icon font for widgets
- `screenshots/` - Editor screenshots

## Troubleshooting

**Font compilation error?**
- Make sure you copied `materialdesignicons-webfont.ttf` to `/config/esphome/fonts/`

**Display not updating?**
- Check `update_interval: never` in display config
- Verify buttons are wired to `component.update: epaper_display`


**Duplicate section errors?**
- Only paste `globals`, `font`, `text_sensor`, `button`, `script`, `display` from generated snippet
- Don't copy `output`, `rtttl`, `sensor`, `time` - these are in the hardware template

**Compilation Fails ("Killed signal" / Out of Memory)?**
If your Raspberry Pi crashes with `Killed signal terminated program`, it lacks the RAM for these fonts.

**Try this first:**
Add `compile_process_limit: 1` to your `esphome:` section in the YAML. This reduces memory usage but slows down compilation.

**If that fails, compile on your PC:**

1. **Install ESPHome**: Install Python, then run `pip install esphome` in your terminal.
2. **Setup Folder**: Create a folder like `C:\esphome_build` (**Important**: No spaces in the folder path!).
3. **Copy Files**: Copy your `reterminal.yaml` and the `fonts/` folder into that folder.
4. **Compile**: Run this command:
   ```powershell
   python -m esphome compile C:\esphome_build\reterminal.yaml
   ```
5. **Upload**: Take the generated `.bin` file and upload it via the Home Assistant ESPHome dashboard (Install → Manual Download).
