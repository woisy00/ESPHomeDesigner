# reTerminal Dashboard Designer

**No more hand-coding ESPHome display lambdas! 🎉**

Got a Seeed Studio reTerminal E1001 and frustrated with manually writing display code? Yeah, me too. So I built a drag-and-drop editor that runs right inside Home Assistant.

Design your e-ink dashboard visually, click generate, flash it - done. No YAML wrestling required (unless you're into that).

## What Does It Do?

- **Visual drag-and-drop editor** - Design layouts in your browser, see your actual HA entities update live on the canvas
- **Multiple pages** - Navigate with hardware buttons, set different refresh rates per page
- **Auto-generates ESPHome config** - Clean, readable YAML that you can paste into your existing ESPHome setup
- **Round-trip editing** - Import existing ESPHome configs back into the editor
- **Full device integration** - Exposes buttons, buzzer, temperature, humidity sensors back to HA for automations
- **Smart power management** - Battery monitoring, configurable refresh intervals, deep sleep support

**Use case:** Display a weather page when you wake up, switch to a sensor dashboard during the day, show a specific alert page when the doorbell rings - all automated through Home Assistant.

## Quick Start

### 1. Install via HACS

1. Add this repository to HACS as a custom repository
2. Search for "reTerminal Dashboard Designer" and install
3. Restart Home Assistant
4. Go to **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → **Add Integration** → Search for "reTerminal Dashboard Designer"

### 2. Prepare Your reTerminal Hardware

**Important:** Copy the Material Design Icons font file first!

From this repo: `font_ttf/font_ttf/materialdesignicons-webfont.ttf`  
To your ESPHome: `/config/esphome/fonts/materialdesignicons-webfont.ttf`

(Create the `fonts` folder if it doesn't exist)

Then use the provided hardware template:

1. Open `esphome/reterminal_e1001_lambda.yaml` in this repo
2. Follow the step-by-step instructions in the template
3. Create a new ESPHome device and paste the hardware sections
4. Change the framework from `esp-idf` to `arduino` in your ESP32 config
5. Flash the base config to your reTerminal

The template includes all the hardware setup: display driver, buttons, buzzer, sensors, battery monitoring.

### 3. Design Your Dashboard

1. Open the integration at `/reterminal-dashboard` in Home Assistant
2. Drag widgets onto the 800x480 canvas
3. Add your sensors, weather entities, icons, shapes
4. Create multiple pages with different refresh rates
5. Click **"Generate Snippet"**

### 4. Flash It

1. Copy the generated YAML snippet
2. Paste it at the bottom of your ESPHome config (below the hardware sections)
3. **Important:** Only paste these sections from the snippet:
   - `globals:`
   - `font:`
   - `text_sensor:` (only if you used sensor widgets)
   - `button:` (optional - for HA control)
   - `script:`
   - `display:`
4. Do NOT copy `output:`, `rtttl:`, `sensor:`, or `time:` - these are already in the hardware template!
5. Compile and flash via ESPHome

Done! Your custom dashboard is now running on the reTerminal.

## Widget Types

- **Text** - Static labels and headers
- **Sensor Text** - Live values from Home Assistant entities
- **Icon** - Material Design Icons (48x48)
- **Shapes** - Rectangles, filled rectangles, circles, filled circles, lines
- **More coming** - Weather cards, graphs, images...

## Features

- **Visual Editor** - Drag-and-drop canvas with snap-to-grid, live entity state updates
- **Entity Picker** - Browse and search your actual HA entities with real-time preview
- **Multi-Page Support** - Create up to 10 pages, each with custom refresh intervals
- **Hardware Integration** - Buttons, buzzer, temperature/humidity sensors exposed to HA
- **Smart Generator** - Produces clean, additive YAML that doesn't conflict with your base config
- **Round-Trip Editing** - Import existing ESPHome display code back into the editor
- **Battery Management** - Voltage monitoring, battery level percentage, icon indicators
- **Power Saving** - Configurable refresh rates, deep sleep support for night hours

## Technical Details

The generator produces **additive YAML only** - it won't touch your WiFi, API, or OTA settings.

**What it generates:**
- `globals:` - Display page tracking, refresh intervals
- `font:` - Inter fonts (sizes 19/22/24) + Material Design Icons with dynamic glyph collection
- `text_sensor:` - Home Assistant entities used in your widgets
- `button:` - Page navigation and refresh controls (exposed to HA)
- `script:` - Smart refresh logic with per-page interval support
- `display:` - Lambda code that renders your layout

**What you provide** (via the hardware template):
- `esphome:`, `esp32:`, `wifi:`, `api:`, `ota:`, `logger:`
- Hardware sections: `psram`, `i2c`, `spi`, `time`
- Physical components: `output`, `rtttl`, `sensor`, `binary_sensor`

The workflow is safe and deterministic - same layout always produces the same YAML.

## Automation Ideas

Once your dashboard is running, you can use Home Assistant automations to:

- **Doorbell alert** - Switch to page 2 and play the Star Wars theme on the buzzer when someone rings the doorbell
- **Weather alerts** - Jump to alert page when severe weather detected
- **Timer display** - Show kitchen timer on page 3 when cooking
- **Button triggers** - Use physical buttons to trigger HA automations
- **Bedtime mode** - Deep sleep between midnight-6am, wake for hourly weather updates
- **Presence detection** - Show "Welcome home" page when you arrive
- **Custom sounds** - Play any RTTTL melody on the buzzer for notifications

The reTerminal becomes both an **information display** and a **physical control interface** for your smart home. The buzzer can play any RTTTL (RingTone Text Transfer Language) melody you want - Star Wars, Nokia ringtone, custom chimes, whatever!

## Hardware Support

**Currently Supported:**
- Seeed Studio reTerminal E1001 (ESP32-S3, 800x480 e-paper)

**Hardware Features Exposed:**
- 3 physical buttons (GPIO 3/4/5)
- RTTTL buzzer (GPIO 45)
- SHT4x temp/humidity sensor (I2C)
- Battery voltage monitoring (ADC GPIO1)
- WiFi signal strength

All exposed as Home Assistant entities for use in automations.

## Repository Structure

- `custom_components/reterminal_dashboard/` - Home Assistant integration
  - `yaml_generator.py` - Generates ESPHome snippets from layouts
  - `yaml_parser.py` - Imports ESPHome code back into editor
  - `frontend/editor.html` - Visual drag-and-drop editor UI
- `esphome/reterminal_e1001_lambda.yaml` - Hardware template with step-by-step instructions
- `font_ttf/font_ttf/materialdesignicons-webfont.ttf` - Icon font for widgets
- `screenshots/` - Editor screenshots

## Troubleshooting

**Font compilation error?**
- Make sure you copied `materialdesignicons-webfont.ttf` to `/config/esphome/fonts/`

**Display not updating?**
- Check `update_interval: never` in display config
- Verify buttons are wired to `component.update: epaper_display`

**Wrong framework error?**
- Change ESP32 framework from `esp-idf` to `arduino` in your config

**Duplicate section errors?**
- Only paste `globals`, `font`, `text_sensor`, `button`, `script`, `display` from generated snippet
- Don't copy `output`, `rtttl`, `sensor`, `time` - these are in the hardware template
