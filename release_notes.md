## v0.7.0 - Experimental LVGL & Enhancements

**Release Date:** December 14, 2025

### 🔧 Architecture Changes
- **Decoupled Hardware Profile**: Hardware definition logic has been moved out of `yaml_export.js` into dedicated `hardware_generators.js` and `devices.js` files, significantly improving code maintainability and safety.

### 🚀 Rebranding & Scope Expansion
- **Project Renamed to ESPHome Designer**: Refleting our broader mission to support all display types.
- **Support for More Displays**: We are moving beyond just e-ink to support OLED, LCD, and Touch displays.
- **New Repository**: `https://github.com/koosoli/ESPHomeDesigner`

### 🎉 New Features
- **Dark Mode Option**: Added a toggle in Device Settings to enable global "Dark Mode" (black background with white widgets). Individual pages can override this setting via Page Settings with options: "Use Global Setting", "Light Mode", or "Dark Mode".
- **Gray Color Support**: Full support for "Gray" color has been implemented for icons, text, and all other widgets.
- **Sensor Text Intelligence**:
  - **Smart Type Handling**: Decoupled text vs. numeric sensor registration. "Is Text Sensor" now forces a unique text-based internal ID, fixing "NaN" issues when an entity is previously registered as a number (e.g. in a graph).
  - **Default Precision**: Sensor text widgets now default to 2 decimal places (e.g. `23.50`) instead of raw float output, improving default legibility. Precision can still be set to `-1` for raw output.

- **Experimental LVGL Widgets**: Added experimental support for LVGL `button`, `arc`, `chart` (Line/Bar), `slider`, `bar`, `image`, and `qrcode` widgets.
- **Text Sensor Enhancements**:
  - **Dual Sensor Support**: Now supports displaying two sensors in one widget.
  - **Prefix & Suffix**: Added settings for custom prefix and suffix text.
  - **Hide Default Unit**: Added checkbox to suppress the default unit, allowing for cleaner custom formatting with Postfix.
- **Time & Date Widget**: Added more formatting options for date display.

#### Calendar Widget
- **Rendering Improvements**: Significant improvements to calendar widget rendering and reliability.
- **Full-Featured Calendar**: Monthly view with upcoming events list
- **Customizable**: Configurable font sizes for all elements (Date, Day, Grid, Events), plus colors and border settings
- **Smart Setup**: Built-in Python helper script downloader simplifies Home Assistant integration
- **Accurate Preview**: What you see is what you get - preview reflects real dates and layout

### 📱 New Hardware Support
- **Waveshare PhotoPainter (ESP32-S3)**: Full support for the Waveshare ESP32-S3 PhotoPainter (7-Color E-Ink).
- **Experimental Support**: Added support for more devices. Note that devices not yet fully verified are explicitly marked as "untested" in the device selector.


### 🐛 Bug Fixes
- **Feature Forecast**: Resolved bug fixes for the weather forecast feature; it should now work correctly.
- **Graph Widget**: Fixed issue where graphs would intersect/overlap incorrectly.
- **Date/Time Alignment Persistence**: Fixed an issue where alignment settings were lost when updating layout from YAML.
- **Duplicate Config Fields**: Resolved an issue where duplicate "Postfix" fields appeared in the Sensor Text widget properties.
- **Disappearing Sensor**: Addressed a root cause where manual YAML editing (required due to UI issues) caused sensor configuration loss.

## v0.6.3 - Entity Handling Improvements

**Release Date:** December 7, 2025

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

#### Sensor Text Widget
- **Graceful Empty Entity Handling**: Fixed compilation error when user creates a sensor_text widget without selecting an entity. Now displays "--" placeholder instead of generating invalid `id().state` code
- **Auto Sensor Import**: Sensor text and progress bar widgets using Home Assistant entities (`sensor.*`, `text_sensor.*`) now automatically generate the required `platform: homeassistant` sensor imports in YAML

#### Duplicate Sensor Prevention
- **Shared Sensor Deduplication**: Fixed potential duplicate sensor definitions when the same entity is used across multiple widget types (e.g., using the same sensor in both a graph and sensor_text widget). All numeric sensors now share a single tracking set to prevent duplicates
